# Tidefall 2.0.0

not obfuscated, has a basic hwid check and a discord webhook implementation (pretty easy to bypass, you just change the webhook id and the pastebin.raw link)

made by CapyKing10  (its an old version, made around 22/12/2024)

Edit: if you want to use this, remember to use the fabric api + meteor for the same version as this client (idk what capy did but it just doesnt work without meteor)
